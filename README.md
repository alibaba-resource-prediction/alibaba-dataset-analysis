Some scripts are self-contained and do not require any other scripts to be run first.

Other scripts depend on the output of other scripts. Is pretty easy to tell which scripts are self-contained and which are not, but you have to check manually.

inside the plots directory, there are some plots that are generated by the scripts.
Specifically, the plots/top_cpu_utilization_with_callers/<DAY>/ dir has plots that show the CPU utilization of a MS and its top callers. The MSs used as the "downstream" MSs are the ones in the plots/top_cpu_utilization/top_cpu_utilization_day_<DAY>.txt files. They were found  by ranking by avg. CPU utilization over the day.

You might need to adjust the dask cluster config in config.py to use more or less workers, depending on the size of the data you are working with.
